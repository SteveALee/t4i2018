GDPR statement

Other than through web analytics this website collects no data or information about visitors to it.

The analytics (anonymous) will be used by the website creator, and members of T4I board to monitor traffic on the website that may then be used in inform promotional activities for the Technology for Independence annual conferences.

Those people who go on to submit contributions and/or register for the conference will be asked for personal data during the submission and registration processes respectively. These data will be used by the T4I conference organizers to determine the conference programme and with the agreement of the individuals concerned used as contacts database for the operation of future T4I conferences and connected activities and events. The information will not be distributed to third parties.

The online registration process is operated at the host institution – namely the University of Sheffield – and their GDPR statement, available to registrants during registration, for use of that data applies.
